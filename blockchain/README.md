# üîó Blockchain Package
This package contains the Solidity smart contracts for the KBC Coffee Trading Project. It leverages [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)  for development, testing, and local blockchain simulation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
1. Navigate to the blockchain directory:
    ```bash
    cd blockchain
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Copy and configure environment:
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
4. Compile contracts:
    ```bash
    npm run compile
    ```
5. Start local blockchain (in a new terminal):
    ```bash
    npm run node
    ```
6. Deploy contracts:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy -- --network localhost
    ```
