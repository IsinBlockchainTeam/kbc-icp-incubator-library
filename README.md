# Decentralized Coffee Trading

This project defines the logic responsible for managing the on-chain operations of the KBC Coffee Trading Project.

The module is composed of _Solidity_ smart contracts and a _NodeJs_ library that wraps the blockchain logic, offering the user a set of user-friendly methods for interacting with the blockchain.
Both packages make use of a common library that contains logic shared between similar projects. This library is hosted on a private _npm_ registry.

## Prerequisites

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) (v.18.x recommended)
- An access token for the ['common' private npm registry](https://gitlab-core.supsi.ch/dti-isin/giuliano.gremlich/blockchain/one_lib_to_rule_them_all)

## Getting Started

- Navigate to the `blockchain` and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file
- Navigate to the `src` folder and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file
