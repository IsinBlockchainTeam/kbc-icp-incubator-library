# Coffee Trading Management Lib

This project defines the logic responsible for managing the on-chain operations of the KBC Coffee Trading Project.

The module is composed of _Solidity_ smart contracts and a _NodeJs_ library that wraps the blockchain logic, offering the user a set of user-friendly methods for interacting with the blockchain.
Both packages make use of a common library that contains logic shared between similar projects. This library is hosted on a private _npm_ registry.
